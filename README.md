OA Election Manager
===================

Wordpress plugin specifically designed to collect election results from a BSA Order of the Arrow election

This plugin is still in the planning stages and no code exists yet.

Nataepu Shohpe Lodge's existing election results entry system utilizes a Google Docs Spreadsheet Form.  We've run into some inconveniences using it which prompted investigating writing this plugin.  Please see the issue tracker at https://github.com/justdave/oaelectionresults/issues for the planning in progress.  Current "bugs" are problems with the existing system that we hope to rectify by writing this.  Enhancements are additional things that would be nice to do.
