OA Election Manager
===================

Wordpress plugin specifically designed to collect election results from a BSA Order of the Arrow election

This plugin is still in development, and it not yet usable. If you know PHP and want to help, we'd welcome it.

Nataepu Shohpe Lodge's existing election results entry system utilizes a Google Docs Spreadsheet Form.  We've run into some inconveniences using it which prompted investigating writing this plugin.  Please see the wiki at https://github.com/oa-bsa/election-manager/wiki for the plans.
